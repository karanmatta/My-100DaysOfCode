Bitwise Operator in Java
In Java, an operator is a symbol that performs the specified operations. In this section, we will discuss only the bitwise operator and its types with proper examples.

Types of Bitwise Operator
There are six types of the bitwise operator in Java:

Bitwise AND
Bitwise exclusive OR
Bitwise inclusive OR
Bitwise Compliment
Bit Shift Operators
Operators	Symbol	Uses
Bitwise AND	&	op1 & op2
Bitwise exclusive OR	^	op1 ^ op2
Bitwise inclusive OR	|	op1 | op2
Bitwise Compliment	~	~ op
Bitwise left shift	<<	op1 << op2
Bitwise right shift	>>	op1 >> op2
Unsigned Right Shift Operator	>>> op >>>	number of places to shift
Let's explain the bitwise operator in detail.

Bitwise AND (&)
It is a binary operator denoted by the symbol &. It returns 1 if and only if both bits are 1, else returns 0.
