 Inheritance 
Inheritance is a process in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of its parent object automatically. In such a way, you can reuse, extend or modify the attributes and behaviors which are defined in other classes. 
In Java, the class which inherits the members of another class is called derived class and the class whose members are inherited is called base class. The derived class is the specialized class for the base class. 
Types of Inheritance : 
1. Single inheritance : When one class inherits another class, it is known as single level inheritance 
class Shape {
   public void area() {
       System.out.println("Displays Area of Shape");
   }
}
class Triangle extends Shape {
   public void area(int h, int b) {
       System.out.println((1/2)*b*h);
   }  
}

2. Hierarchical inheritance : Hierarchical inheritance is defined as the process of deriving more than one class from a base class. 
class Shape {
   public void area() {
       System.out.println("Displays Area of Shape");
   }
}
class Triangle extends Shape {
   public void area(int h, int b) {
       System.out.println((1/2)*b*h);
   }  
}
class Circle extends Shape {
   public void area(int r) {
       System.out.println((3.14)*r*r);
   }  
}

3. Multilevel inheritance : Multilevel inheritance is a process of deriving a class from another derived class. 
class Shape {
   public void area() {
       System.out.println("Displays Area of Shape");
   }
}
class Triangle extends Shape {
   public void area(int h, int b) {
       System.out.println((1/2)*b*h);
   }  
}
class EquilateralTriangle extends Triangle {
   int side;
}

4. Hybrid inheritance : Hybrid inheritance is a combination of 
simple, multiple inheritance and hierarchical inheritance. 








Polymorphism 
Polymorphism is the ability to present the same interface for differing underlying forms (data types). With polymorphism, each of these classes will have different underlying data. Precisely, Poly means ‘many’ and morphism means ‘forms’. 

Runtime Polymorphism : Runtime polymorphism is also known as dynamic polymorphism. Function overriding is an example of runtime polymorphism. Function overriding means when the child class contains the method which is already present in the parent class. Hence, the child class overrides the method of the parent class. In case of function overriding, parent and child classes both contain the same function with a different definition. The call to the function is determined at runtime is known as runtime polymorphism.

class Shape {
   public void area() {
       System.out.println("Displays Area of Shape");
   }
}
class Triangle extends Shape {
   public void area(int h, int b) {
       System.out.println((1/2)*b*h);
   }  
}
class Circle extends Shape {
   public void area(int r) {
       System.out.println((3.14)*r*r);
   }  
}
