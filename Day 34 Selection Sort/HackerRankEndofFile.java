/* Java End-Of-File
In computing, End Of File (commonly abbreviated EOF) is a condition in a computer operating system where no more data can be read from a data source. (Wikipedia)
Sometimes you don't know how many lines are there in a file and you need to read the file until EOF or End-of-file. In this problem you need to read a file until EOF and print the contents of the file. You must take input from stdin(System.in).
Hints: One way to do this is to use hasNext() function in java scanner class.
Input Format
Each line will contain a non-empty string. Read until EOF.
Output Format
For each line, print the line number followed by a single space and the line content.

//TestCases:-
//Input (stdin)
//Hello world   
//I am a file
//Read me until end-of-file.

//Output
//1 Hello world
//2 I am a file
//3 Read me until end-of-file.
