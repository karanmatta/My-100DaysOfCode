Doubly Circular Linked List

A doubly circular linked list is a linked list in which each node has two pointers, one to the next node and one to the previous node. The last node points to the first node and the first node points to the last node.



Circular Doubly Linked List has properties of both doubly linked list and circular linked list in which two consecutive elements are linked or connected by the previous and next pointer and the last node points to the first node by the next pointer and also the first node points to the last node by the previous pointer.

Circular Doubly Linked List is a type of linked list in which the last node points to the first node and the first node points to the last node. It is a combination of circular linked list and doubly linked list. In circular doubly linked list, each node has two pointers, one to the next node and one to the previous node. The last node points to the first node and the first node points to the last node.


Advantages of circular doubly linked list: 
The list can be traversed from both directions i.e. from head to tail or from tail to head.
Jumping from head to tail or from tail to head is done in constant time O(1).
Circular Doubly Linked Lists are used for the implementation of advanced data structures like the Fibonacci Heap.

Disadvantages of circular doubly linked list: 
It takes slightly extra memory in each node to accommodate the previous pointer.
Lots of pointers are involved while implementing or doing operations on a list. So, pointers should be handled carefully otherwise data of the list may get lost.

Applications of Circular doubly linked list:
Managing song playlists in media player applications.
Managing shopping carts in online shopping.
