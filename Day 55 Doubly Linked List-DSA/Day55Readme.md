Doubly Circular Linked List

A doubly circular linked list is a linked list in which each node has two pointers, one to the next node and one to the previous node. The last node points to the first node and the first node points to the last node.


Advantages

* It is easy to traverse the list in both directions.
* It is easy to insert and delete a node in the list.

Disadvantages

* It is difficult to access the previous node of the first node.
* It is difficult to access the next node of the last node.


Operations

* Insertion
* Deletion
* Traversal
* Search
* Reverse


Insertion

Insertion in a doubly circular linked list is similar to insertion in a doubly linked list. The only difference is that the last node points to the first node and the first node points to the last node.

Deletion

Deletion in a doubly circular linked list is similar to deletion in a doubly linked list. The only difference is that the last node points to the first node and the first node points to the last node.

Traversal

Traversal in a doubly circular linked list is similar to traversal in a doubly linked list. The only difference is that the last node points to the first node and the first node points to the last node.

Search

Search in a doubly circular linked list is similar to search in a doubly linked list. The only difference is that the last node points to the first node and the first node points to the last node.

Reverse

Reverse in a doubly circular linked list is similar to reverse in a doubly linked list. The only difference is that the last node points to the first node and the first node points to the last node.
